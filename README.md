Since recently, the repositories Libra (libra-code), Libra-X, and Pyxaid2 have been moved to the
new location - the Quantum-Dynamics-Hub organization The codes there were initially the forks from those
at this repo, so I have deleted the present ones (on Aug 24, 2017) to give those repos the priority - now,
they are truly the originals - the central repo. In the futures, you may see these codes "back" on my
own repository - but there will be the forks from the centralized Quantum-Dynamics-Hub.
